This link:https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda] serves a singular purpose:
bring JSON files from an S3 bucket into Delta Lake. This can be highly useful
for legacy or external processes which rely on uploading JSON to an S3 bucket
and cannot be properly updated to write directly to link:https://delta.io[Delta
Lake].
