= Delta S3 Loader


Delta S3 Loader is a project to quickly and cheaply bring JSON files added to
S3 buckets into Delta Lake. This can be highly useful for legacy or external
processes which rely on uploading JSON to an S3 bucket and cannot be properly
updated to write directly to link:https://delta.io[Delta Lake].

Delta S3 Loader can be built into a stnadalone binary or an
link:https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda].
